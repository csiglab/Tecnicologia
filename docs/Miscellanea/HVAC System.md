## Heat Removal Methods

| **Method** | **Principle** | **Used In** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Vapor Compression Cycle** | Uses a refrigerant in a closed loop; heat is absorbed by **evaporation** at low pressure and released during **condensation** at high pressure. | Most residential and commercial AC systems |
| **Evaporative Cooling** | Heat is removed by **evaporation of water**, which absorbs latent heat from air. | Swamp coolers, arid climate coolers |
| **Absorption Cooling** | Uses a **thermal energy source** (e.g., gas, solar) instead of electricity to drive the refrigeration cycle using a refrigerant–absorbent pair (e.g., water–LiBr). | Industrial cooling, cogeneration |
| **Thermal Storage Cooling** | Removes heat by **shifting cooling load** to off-peak times using stored chilled water or ice. | District cooling, energy-efficient systems |
| **Heat Exchange with Outside Air** | Uses **ventilation and air exchange** with outdoor air when outside is cooler. | Economizer mode, passive systems |
| **Geothermal Heat Pumps** | Transfers heat to/from **underground thermal mass** using fluid loops. | Ground-source HVAC systems |
| **Thermoelectric Cooling** | Uses the **Peltier effect** to create a temperature difference via solid-state electronics. | Compact or portable cooling systems |
| **Radiative Cooling** | Surfaces emit infrared radiation to **cool below ambient**, especially at night. | Emerging tech in passive cooling |

## 🌀 **Core Components for Heat Removal**

| **Component** | **Function in Heat Removal** |
| --- | --- |
| **Evaporator** | Absorbs heat from indoor air into refrigerant (via phase change) |
| **Condenser** | Releases heat to outside air or water (condenses refrigerant) |
| **Compressor** | Increases refrigerant pressure & temperature to enable heat rejection |
| **Expansion Valve** | Lowers pressure so refrigerant can evaporate and absorb heat again |
| **Fans & Blowers** | Move air across coils to enhance convection and air exchange |
| **Cooling Tower** | Transfers heat to the atmosphere (in large-scale chilled water systems) |
