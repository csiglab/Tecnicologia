## Construction Rock

| **Rock Type** | **Rock Name** | **Key Properties** | **Common Uses** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Igneous** | **Granite** | Hard, durable, weather-resistant, high compressive strength | Building blocks, countertops, monuments | Often polished for aesthetics |
|  | **Basalt** | Fine-grained, high density, strong, dark-colored | Road base, rail ballast, aggregates | Abundant and inexpensive |
|  | **Diorite** | Tough, coarse-grained, intermediate color | Flooring, facing stone | Less common than granite |
|  | **Gabbro** | Dense, coarse-grained, dark-colored | Pavements, construction aggregate | Similar to basalt, but plutonic |
| **Sedimentary** | **Limestone** | Soft to medium-hard, easily carved, reacts with acid | Cement production, building stone | Can form karst in contact with water |
|  | **Sandstone** | Medium hardness, porous, varies in strength | Walls, paving, decorative facades | Color varies based on mineral content |
|  | **Shale** | Fine-grained, splits easily | Bricks, lightweight blocks | Not strong alone, used in processed form |
|  | **Travertine** | Porous limestone, attractive banding | Tiles, facades, decorative uses | Popular in classical architecture |
| **Metamorphic** | **Marble** | Crystalline, soft, polishable, attractive veining | Flooring, sculptures, facades | Weathering-prone outdoors |
|  | **Slate** | Fissile, durable, non-porous | Roofing, flooring, wall cladding | Good thermal resistance |
|  | **Quartzite** | Extremely hard, non-foliated, resistant to weathering | Road aggregate, countertops, tiles | Tougher than marble or granite |
|  | **Schist** | Foliated, sparkly (mica), moderate strength | Decorative stone, sometimes wall stone | Not as strong structurally |
| **Artificial** | **Concrete (Mix)** | Engineered mix of cement, sand, aggregates | Structural frames, pavements, bridges | Not a rock but a key building material |
|  | **Brick (from clay)** | Baked clay, variable strength | Walls, pavements | Derived from shale/silt/clay |
