## Terminology

- **Power (W)** → Instantaneous usage (watts).
- **Energy (kWh)** → Total consumption over time; what the utility bills you for.

## Tools to Measure Electricity Consumption

| Tool                                                                       | Description                                                        | Typical Use                                                     |

| 🔌 **Plug-in Power Meter** (e.g., Kill-A-Watt, Gosund, Sonoff)             | Measures how much electricity an individual appliance uses.        | Plug small devices like TVs, microwaves, or induction cookers.  |
| ⚡ **Smart Plug with Energy Monitoring**                                    | Connects via Wi-Fi or app; shows real-time and historical data.    | Continuous monitoring of appliances; automation possible.       |
| 🏠 **Home Energy Monitor (Whole-House)** (e.g., Sense, Emporia, Shelly EM) | Connects to the electrical panel to track the entire house.        | Measures total consumption and sometimes identifies appliances. |
| 📟 **Multimeter or Clamp Meter**                                           | Measures current (A) and voltage (V); manual calculation of power. | For individual circuits or appliances (requires caution).       |
