| Technique        | Description                         | Efficiency | Notes                                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Boiling          | Water-based heat transfer           | High       | Works well with grains, legumes, roots. |
| Steaming         | Moist heat with minimal water       | High       | Retains nutrients better.               |
| Pressure cooking | High-temp steam under pressure      | Very High  | Reduces cooking time, saves energy.     |
| Stir-frying      | Quick cooking with small oil amount | Moderate   | Useful for mixed-ingredient meals.      |
| Baking           | Dry heat, long process              | Low        | Not ideal for low-cost systems.         |
