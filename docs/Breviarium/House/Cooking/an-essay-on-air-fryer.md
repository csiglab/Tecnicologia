# An Essay on Air Fryers

> This essay explores air fryers from a user and technical perspective, emphasizing technologies, performance, usage, and maintenance.

## Formulation

> An air fryer is a kitchen appliance that cooks food by circulating hot air around it, producing a crispy layer similar to frying but using minimal or no oil. It combines convection cooking with rapid air circulation technology to achieve fast and even cooking.

## Terminology
