# An Essay on Induction Cooking

> In this essay, we explore **induction cooking** — its underlying principles, technological enablers, materials, evaluation criteria, and market models.

## Formulation

> **What is induction cooking?**

**Induction cooking** is a method of heating where electrical energy is transferred directly to the cookware through electromagnetic induction rather than conventional thermal conduction or radiation.
A magnetic field generated by a coil beneath the cooking surface induces electric currents (eddy currents) in the ferromagnetic cookware, causing it to heat up directly and efficiently.
