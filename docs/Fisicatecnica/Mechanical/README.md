# Mechanical System

> **Statical Mechanical System:** System at rest or in equilibrium; no motion or velocity changes over time.
> 

> **Dynamic Mechanical System:**  A **dynamic mechanical system** is a system in which **time-dependent forces and motions are significant**. It involves components that experience acceleration, inertia, vibrations, or transient responses, requiring analysis of how the system evolves over time under varying loads.
> 

> Rigid body mechanics is the theory; mechanical mechanisms are the application of that theory to real devices.
> 

> **Mechanical mechanisms** operate under the principles of **rigid body mechanics**, but with a focus on **how multiple rigid bodies interact** through joints and constraints to produce controlled motion.
> 

> Mechanical engineering is fundamentally an art—the creative synthesis of new machines and mechanisms. This process is not purely deductive; it relies on experimentation, intuition, and iterative design. Engineers investigate the interplay of materials, forces, and motions, uncovering solutions through hands-on practice and inventive insight rather than through formal reasoning alone.

## Formulation

> **Mechanical engineering** deals not just with idealized particles or single rigid bodies, but with **complex assemblies of interconnected rigid bodies**.
> 

These assemblies (mechanisms, machines, structures) exhibit behaviors that are often **non-intuitive and surprising** due to:

1. **Multiple Degrees of Freedom:** Each link or component can move in constrained ways, and the combination creates complex motion patterns.
2. **Interdependencies:** Forces, torques, and accelerations in one part propagate throughout the system.
3. **Nonlinear Effects:** Small changes in configuration or input can produce large, sometimes unexpected changes in output motion or stress.
4. **Emergent Phenomena:** Vibrations, resonance, stability issues, or coupled oscillations emerge only in systems, not in single-body models.

| --- | --- | --- |
| **Static Mechanical System** | System at rest or in equilibrium; no motion or velocity changes over time. | Forces balanced, no acceleration, no inertia effects. Examples: a bridge holding load, a stationary crane. |
| **Dynamic Mechanical System** | System involving motion, acceleration, and time-dependent forces. | Includes inertia, vibrations, oscillations, transient behaviors. Examples: engines, pendulums, vehicles. |
| **Rigid Body System** | Assumes components do not deform; idealized solid objects. | Simplifies analysis by ignoring elastic deformation. Examples: gears, linkages modeled as rigid parts. |
| **Deformable Body System** | Components experience elastic or plastic deformation under loads. | Requires stress-strain analysis; accounts for material behavior. Examples: beams bending under load, springs. |
