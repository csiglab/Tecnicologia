> Physics offers an analytical framework for understanding reality, forming the foundation of technical science. Technical science builds on this foundation to design and construct complex objects whose behaviors and properties cannot be fully captured by simplified or idealized models. Studying these systems requires experimentation, intuition, and hands-on engagement with the objects themselves.

> I focus on both **theoretical frameworks** and **practical implementations** that enable precise, efficient, and robust control of physical phenomena across multiple energy domains. I am particularly interested in how foundational systems (energy, information, material) can be composed into novel machines and derived systems, yielding new capabilities through purposeful design.

## Foundation Abstraction

> System  =  Materials + Techniques + Energy + Purpose + Information + Environment.
> 

> A **Foundational System** is a primary, original system that serves as the basic building block or core framework. It provides essential functions, principles, or structures from which other systems can be developed or derived. Foundational systems are often considered fundamental or irreducible within a particular domain.
> 

> A **Derived System** is a system that is built upon, extends, or is constructed from one or more foundational systems. It inherits properties, behaviors, or components from the foundational system(s) but typically includes modifications, specializations, or additional features that distinguish it from the original.
> 

### Energy

> The capacity to perform work or cause physical change. Energy exists in various forms—kinetic, potential, thermal, electrical, chemical—and can be transformed but not created or destroyed (conservation of energy).
> 

> In engineered systems, energy is the **driving resource** that enables processes, actuation, and transformation.
> 

### Material

> The physical substance or matter from which systems, components, and environments are composed. Materials possess properties—mechanical, thermal, electrical—that determine how they respond to forces, energy, and environmental conditions.
> 

### Information

> Actually: Data.
> 

> A measure of meaningful patterns, distinctions, or correlations in data that reduce uncertainty in a given context. In physical systems, information is represented, processed, and transmitted through symbolic or physical states (e.g., voltage levels, signals, digital codes).
> 

### Machine

> An organized system of interacting components designed to transform, transmit, or utilize **energy**, **material**, and **information** to perform specific functions or tasks. Machines can be mechanical, electrical, biological, or computational, and often combine multiple domains.
> 

### Engine

> An **engine is a specific type of machine** designed to convert one **form of energy** into **mechanical energy or motion**. Engines are commonly associated with power generation and propulsion.
> 

> **Note:** If the source of energy is **electric**, the device is typically called a **motor**; if it uses **chemical fuel** (like gasoline or diesel), it's called an **engine**. However, the two terms are often used interchangeably in everyday language.
> 

> **Note:** An *engine* is a conceptual abstraction, not a system in itself. It can be implemented using various underlying technologies, depending on the context and requirements.
