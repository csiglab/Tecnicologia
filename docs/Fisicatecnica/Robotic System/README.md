QA:

- What is the simplest project to start in robotics? It’s start a project with quadcopter or something related to drones?’

## Formulation

## **1. Robot System Definition**

Let a robot be represented as a tuple:

[

\mathcal{R} = (S, A, C)

]

Where:

- (S) = **State space** — all possible states of the robot and possibly parts of the environment it can observe
- (A) = **Action space (Actuators)** — all actions the robot can perform
- (C: S \to A) = **Control / Computation function** — maps states (or observations) to actions

---

## **2. Environment**

Let the environment be:

[

\mathcal{E} = (X, T)

]

Where:

- (X) = Environment state space
- (T: X \times A \to X) = **Transition function** describing how actions change the environment

---

## **3. Sensor Model**

The robot perceives the environment through sensors:

[

O: X \to S

]

- (O) = Observation function mapping environment states to perceived states
- Can include noise: (s_t = O(x_t) + \epsilon)

---

## **4. Goal Specification**

The goal is defined as a **cost or reward function**:

[

G: S \times A \to \mathbb{R}

]

- Can be generalized as a **utility function** to maximize (or a cost function to minimize)
- Encodes task success, constraints, and preferences

---

## **5. Robot Problem Statement**

Given:

- Robot (\mathcal{R} = (S, A, C))
- Environment (\mathcal{E} = (X, T))
- Observation function (O)
- Goal function (G)

Find a control function (C^*) such that the robot selects actions (a_t = C^*(s_t)) over time (t = 0 \dots T) to **maximize cumulative reward** (or achieve goal) while respecting system and environment constraints:

[

C^* = \arg\max_{C} \sum_{t=0}^{T} G(s_t, a_t)

]

Subject to:

[

\begin{cases}

s_t = O(x_t) \

x_{t+1} = T(x_t, a_t) \

a_t \in A, \ s_t \in S, \ x_t \in X

\end{cases}

]

---

This formalization covers:

- **Actuators** → (A)
- **Internal Computation** → (C)
- **Goal** → (G)
- **Environment** → ((X, T))
- **Sensors** → (O)
