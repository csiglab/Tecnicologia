- How to modify the **founder line (T₀ Generation Plant)**? Use lab techniques like **CRISPR** or **Agrobacterium** to change the DNA of a plant cell, then grow that cell into a full plant. This first modified plant is called the **T₀ plant**.
- How the host produce new modify seeds? The T₀ plant produces **flowers**, which create **pollen and eggs** with the new DNA. When the plant **self-pollinates**, the seeds that form have the **modified genome**.
- Which techniques to seed?
    - Transgenic Approach (Genetic Engineering)
    - Genome Editing (CRISPR-Cas9)
    - Agrobacterium tumefaciens
    - Biolistic (Gene Gun)
    - Electroporation / PEG
