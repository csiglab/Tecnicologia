# Digital Twin

> A **Digital Twin** is a **virtual representation** of a **physical object, system, or process** that is **continuously updated** with **real-time data** from its real-world counterpart. It uses sensors, simulations, and analytics to **mirror, monitor, and model** the behavior and performance of the physical entity throughout its lifecycle.
> 

> Note: This is a much more than a simulation; it is a bidirectional mapping; from reality to the twin, and from the twin to reality.

A **digital twin** is:

- **A continuously updated digital representation** of a specific real-world object, system, or process.
- **Linked in real time** (or near real time) to the physical counterpart via sensors, telemetry, and data feeds.
- **Bidirectional** in some implementations — changes in the digital model can influence the real system (e.g., adjusting a factory line based on the twin’s optimization).
- **Lifecycle-aware** — it’s meant to track the object from design, through operation, to decommissioning.

Applications:

- **Manufacturing**: Monitor machine health and predict maintenance needs.
- **Urban Planning**: Simulate traffic, utilities, and infrastructure in smart cities.
- **Healthcare**: Create patient-specific physiological models for personalized medicine.
- **Aerospace**: Simulate aircraft systems for diagnostics and testing.

## History

| Period | Technology Stage | Description | Controllers’ Role | Relation to Digital Twin Concept |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1940s–1970s** | **Early Industrial Control** | Relay logic, pneumatic controllers, early PLCs; direct signal → action | Execute logic based on sensor inputs; no persistent model of plant | None — purely reactive, no virtual representation |
| **1980s–1990s** | **Offline Digital Models & Visualization** | SCADA, HMI displays, and standalone simulators for training | Controllers feed telemetry to visual dashboards | Still not twins — visualizations show current state but don’t simulate or predict |
| **1990s–2000s** | **Advanced Control with Embedded Models** | Model Predictive Control (MPC), virtual commissioning | Controllers integrate mathematical models for optimization | Partial — model-based control begins to blur line toward twins, but models often limited in scope and not lifecycle-aware |
| **2000s–2010s** | **Pre-Digital Twin Integration** | IoT, high-fidelity process models linked with live data | Controllers provide continuous data streams to analytical software | Close — live-linked models exist, but “digital twin” term still rare outside NASA and aerospace |
| **2010s–Present** | **Formal Digital Twin Era** | Persistent, real-time, asset-specific models linked to sensors; lifecycle tracking | Controllers act as data acquisition & actuation backbone for twins | Full — controllers enable but are not the twin; twin integrates CAD, physics, ML, and control data |
| **Present–Near Future** | **Bidirectional & Autonomous Twins** | Digital twins that adjust real assets autonomously and simulate future states | Controllers receive predictive commands from the twin | Merged — control + twin form a cyber-physical loop |
