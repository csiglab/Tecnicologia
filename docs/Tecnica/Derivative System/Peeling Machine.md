> **Peeling** refers to the **mechanical, chemical, thermal, or physical separation** of the external layer (peel, rind, skin) from a raw material, often as the first preprocessing step in food or materials industries.
> 

> A **peeling machine** is a **mechanical or automated device** designed to **remove the outer layer (skin, peel, or husk)** of a raw material—typically a food product such as fruits, vegetables, or tubers—in a **controlled, efficient, and scalable** manner.

## Structure

| 🧩 Component | 🔧 Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Feeding Hopper** | Initial entry point where raw plantains are loaded. |
| **Conveyor System** | Transports plantains through the peeling stages. |
| **Peeling Mechanism** | Mechanical or pneumatic system that removes the skin (blades, rollers, brushes, or air jets). |
| **Blades / Abrasive Rollers** | Tools that cut or scrape off the skin without damaging the pulp. |
| **Control Panel / PLC** | Digital interface for adjusting settings such as speed, timing, and pressure. |
| **Discharge Outlet** | Releases the peeled plantains for further processing. |
| **Waste Collection Unit** | Collects discarded peels separately for disposal or reuse. |
| **Cleaning System (Optional)** | Water or air jets that clean plantains post-peeling or the machine itself (CIP). |

## Peeling Method

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Mechanical** | Uses blades, knives, or cutting edges. |
| **Abrasive** | Uses rough surfaces or rollers. |
| **Thermal** | Softens peel with steam or hot water. |
| **Pneumatic** | Uses pressurized air to strip peels. |
| **Chemical** | Uses solutions to loosen the skin (less common due to safety concerns). |
