**Key Components of a Mechatronic System**

1. **Mechanical System** – The physical structure, such as robotic arms, gears, or motors.
2. **Sensors** – Devices that detect environmental changes (e.g., temperature, pressure, motion).
3. **Actuators** – Convert electrical signals into physical movement (e.g., motors, solenoids, hydraulic systems).
4. **Microcontrollers/Computers** – Process sensor data and execute control algorithms.
5. **Software & Control Algorithms** – Implement decision-making, automation, and feedback loops.

**Examples:**

- **Robots** (industrial robots, autonomous vehicles)
- **CNC Machines** (computer-controlled manufacturing machines)
- **Self-Balancing Systems** (Segways, drones)
- **Automated Assembly Lines** (car manufacturing)
- **Smart Home Devices** (automatic doors, smart thermostats)
- **Medical Devices** (prosthetics, robotic surgery systems)
