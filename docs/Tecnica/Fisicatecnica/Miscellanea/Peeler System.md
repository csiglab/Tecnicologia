: 13

> A **Peeler System** is a mechanical or electromechanical apparatus designed to **remove the outer layer or skin** from raw materials—commonly agricultural products such as fruits and vegetables—through mechanical, abrasive, or chemical means. The system typically integrates components for **material handling, surface treatment, and waste removal** to prepare the product for further processing or consumption.
> 

> There is **no single universal peeling system** that works optimally for *all* types of materials or products because peeling requirements vary widely depending on the item’s physical characteristics, surface properties, and desired quality of peeling.
> 

### Key Characteristics:

- **Material Removal:** Efficiently strips peel or skin without damaging the underlying product.
- **Mechanical Components:** Often includes rotating drums, abrasive surfaces, blades, brushes, or knives.
- **Automation:** May incorporate sensors, motors, and controls to regulate operation and improve throughput.
- **Hygiene and Safety:** Designed to meet food safety standards when used in food processing.
- **Waste Management:** Includes mechanisms for separating and removing the peeled skin.

## Common Peeling System Types

| Type | Typical Application | Advantages | Limitations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Abrasive Peeling Systems** | Potatoes, carrots | Simple, low cost | Skin waste, possible damage |
| **Steam Peeling Systems** | Tomatoes, potatoes | Clean, less waste | Higher energy, complex equipment |
| **Chemical Peeling Systems** | Citrus fruits, tomatoes | Precise skin removal | Chemical use, disposal issues |
| **Blade/Knife Peeling Systems** | Apples, potatoes | Precise, low waste | Slower, higher maintenance |
| **Ultrasonic Peeling** | Experimental for delicate fruits | Gentle, minimal damage | Emerging tech, higher cost |
