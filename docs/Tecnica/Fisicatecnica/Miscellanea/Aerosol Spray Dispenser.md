> A basic aerosol spray dispenser without electronics is a **mechanical system** because it converts mechanical actions (pressing the nozzle) into fluid spray via mechanical and physical principles.

## System Structure

- **Container (Canister)** Holds the product (liquid or powder) and propellant under pressure.
- **Valve Assembly**
    - Controls release of the contents when activated.
    - Includes valve stem, seal, spring, and housing.
- **Actuator (Button/Nozzle Cap)**
    - The part the user presses to operate the valve.
    - Often integrates the spray nozzle.
- **Dip Tube** A tube inside the container that draws the product up to the valve.
- **Nozzle** Shapes and atomizes the spray into a fine mist or directed jet.
- **Propellant**
    - The pressurized gas that forces the product out of the container.
    - Can be liquefied gases like propane, butane, or compressed air.
- **Seals and Gaskets** Prevent leakage of product or propellant from the valve and container.
