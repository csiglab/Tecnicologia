## Structure

| Component | Function |
| --- | --- |
| **Battery bank** | Stores energy (usually Li-ion, LiFePO₄, or lead-acid). |
| **Battery Management System (BMS)** | Monitors voltage, current, temperature, and ensures safe operation. |
| **Inverter/Charger** | Converts DC↔AC and controls power flow between grid, solar, and batteries. |
| **Transfer switch or gateway** | Automatically switches between grid and battery supply. |

## Metric

| **Metric** | **Description** | **Case** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Energy Capacity** | Total amount of energy the system can store | kWh for batteries, MWh for grid ESS |
| **Power Rating / Output** | Maximum instantaneous power the system can deliver | kW → MW |
| **Charge/Discharge Rate** | Speed at which the system can charge or discharge | C-rate for batteries (1C = full charge/discharge in 1 hour) |
| **Round-Trip Efficiency** | Fraction of energy recovered vs energy stored | 85–95% for Li-ion, 70–80% for CAES |
| **Cycle Life** | Number of full charge/discharge cycles before capacity drops below threshold | 2000–10000 cycles for Li-ion, 3000–5000 for flow batteries |
| **Depth of Discharge (DoD)** | Percentage of total capacity that can be used safely | 80–90% for Li-ion, 50% for lead-acid |
| **Self-Discharge Rate** | Energy lost per unit time while idle | 1–5% per month for Li-ion, higher for lead-acid |
| **Specific Energy** | Energy stored per unit mass | Wh/kg, important for weight-sensitive applications |
| **Energy Density** | Energy stored per unit volume | Wh/L, relevant for footprint and space |
| **Response Time** | Time to reach full power output | Milliseconds for flywheels, seconds for batteries |
| **Operating Temperature Range** | Temperature limits for safe operation | -20°C → 60°C for Li-ion, higher for NaS |
| **Scalability / Modularity** | Ease of increasing capacity or power by adding modules | Flow batteries and Li-ion systems are highly modular |
| **Cost Metrics** | $/kWh stored, $/kW delivered | $150–400/kWh for Li-ion ESS, $1000+/kWh for pumped hydro |
| **Safety & Reliability** | Risk of failure, thermal runaway, degradation | Fire suppression systems, BMS monitoring, redundancy |
| **Lifetime / Durability** | Years of service under typical operating conditions | 10–20 years for stationary Li-ion ESS |
| **Environmental Impact** | Lifecycle CO₂, recyclability, hazardous material content | Li-ion recycling, lead-acid disposal |
