# Interior Design

> The discipline concerned with shaping interior spaces into coherent, functional, and expressive environments that support human activity and perception.

## Formulation

> Interior Design : Space → Organized Environment.

> A transformation function where Space represents raw spatial potential, and Organized Environment denotes spatial configuration structured by function, aesthetics, and experience.

## Design Principle(s)

> Which principles guide design?

> Principles that guide the transformation of intention into coherent, functional, and expressive form.

### Advice

| **Category**           | **Advice**                               | **Description**                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Space Planning**     | **Start with function**                  | Identify how each area will be used before deciding on layout or style.                    |
| **Space Planning**     | **Maintain clear circulation**           | Leave at least 90 cm of walking space between furniture and walls.                         |
| **Proportion & Scale** | **Match furniture to room size**         | Avoid oversized pieces in small rooms; scale elements to spatial volume.                   |
| **Lighting**           | **Layer your lighting**                  | Combine ambient, task, and accent lighting for flexibility and depth.                      |
| **Lighting**           | **Use warm light for comfort zones**     | Softer, warm-toned lighting enhances relaxation and intimacy.                              |
| **Color & Material**   | **Use color to shape perception**        | Light colors expand space; darker tones create intimacy and focus.                         |
| **Color & Material**   | **Limit the palette**                    | Stick to 3–4 dominant hues to maintain visual coherence.                                   |
| **Texture & Surface**  | **Mix textures subtly**                  | Combine matte and glossy, soft and hard surfaces for sensory balance.                      |
| **Furnishing**         | **Prioritize comfort and accessibility** | Always test seating and ensure furniture supports daily activity patterns.                 |
| **Storage**            | **Integrate storage into design**        | Conceal storage in built-ins or use multi-functional furniture to reduce clutter.          |
| **Acoustics**          | **Use soft materials strategically**     | Rugs, curtains, and upholstery absorb sound and reduce echo.                               |
| **Visual Composition** | **Create focal points**                  | Anchor each room with one dominant element—art, light fixture, or furniture piece.         |
| **Flow & Continuity**  | **Repeat motifs and materials**          | Use recurring elements (colors, trims, finishes) to unify different spaces.                |
| **Sustainability**     | **Prefer durable materials**             | Invest in quality items that age well rather than disposable décor.                        |
| **Adaptability**       | **Design for change**                    | Choose modular or movable elements that can adapt to new needs or configurations.          |
| **Budgeting**          | **Invest in long-term impact**           | Spend more on key items (lighting, flooring, main furniture) and economize on accessories. |
| **Personalization**    | **Express identity through detail**      | Use art, textiles, or objects that reflect the inhabitant’s story and taste.               |
