# Interior Design

> The discipline concerned with shaping interior spaces into coherent, functional, and expressive environments that support human activity and perception.

## Formulation

> Interior Design : Space → Organized Environment / Under Human Interpertain.

> A transformation function where Space represents raw spatial potential, and Organized Environment denotes spatial configuration structured by function, aesthetics, and experience.

## Foundation

> What is the grounding of Interior Design Praxis? What grounds interior design evaluations?

> Interior design is grounded in a **model of the human**—their perception, cognition, affect, and activity patterns—which allows us to reason systematically about space, form, and experience. By understanding how humans perceive, interact with, and are affected by their environments, we can infer a set of design principles that guide spatial, functional, and aesthetic decisions.

> These principles are applied to **optimize environments** so that they support human needs, enhance well-being, communicate meaning, and maintain coherence across spatial, sensory, temporal, and cultural dimensions.

> In essence, interior design praxis is a process of **translating human-centered understanding into structured form**, balancing **function, experience, and context**, while maintaining ethical, sustainable, and culturally resonant choices.

| **Grounding**            | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Human Experience**     | Interior design is fundamentally grounded in the quality of human experience — how spatial, sensory, and symbolic elements shape perception, comfort, and meaning in daily life. |
| **Spatial Cognition**    | Design decisions are guided by how people perceive, navigate, and interpret spatial environments, ensuring legibility, coherence, and orientation.                               |
| **Functional Order**     | Every design must fulfill practical requirements and support the activities, flows, and systems that define the space’s purpose.                                                 |
| **Aesthetic Harmony**    | Evaluation arises from the integration of proportion, materiality, light, and texture into a visually and emotionally coherent whole.                                            |
| **Cultural Symbolism**   | Interiors are also cultural artifacts; they communicate values, identity, and belonging through form, color, and style.                                                          |
| **Systemic Integration** | A space succeeds when structural, environmental, and technological subsystems align seamlessly with human use and symbolic intention.                                            |

### Human Model

> What is the model or theory of a human that guides interior design? How are this models validaded?

> The "model" is not a formal model; rather, it is a set of observations about the human internal and interactional interface with the environment, intended to adapt the environment in ways that enhance performance according to a set of identified “right” or “wrong” metrics.

The dimensions of the model are:

1. **Perceptual** – How humans perceive visual, spatial, and sensory information, including light, color, texture, and form.
2. **Cognitive** – How humans process information, navigate spaces, and understand functional layouts.
3. **Emotional** – How environments influence mood, comfort, stress, and wellbeing.
4. **Behavioral** – How humans interact with objects, furniture, and space; patterns of use and activity.
5. **Social (Cultural)** – How humans interact socially, respect privacy, and perceive cultural meaning in spaces.
6. **Ergonomic** – Physical comfort, accessibility, and support for diverse bodily needs.
7. **Adaptive** – How humans respond to change, flexibility, and evolving uses of space.

## Design Meta Principle(s)

> A meta-principle operates at a higher level than stylistic or technical rules: it governs how principles are selected, prioritized, and interpreted by the design agent (human or artificial). It reflects the cognitive and systemic framework through which a designer perceives, evaluates, and structures a spatial environment.

> The meta-principles are grounded in three fundamental dimensions: the **Cognitive–Perceptual**, the **Functional–Systemic**, and the **Symbolic**.

> The fundamental problem of design lies in reconciling the multiplicity of human intentions, perceptual constraints, and systemic realities into a coherent whole. Design is not merely the act of shaping form or function, but the continuous negotiation between cognition and perception—the way things are understood and the way they are seen—between functionality and systemic order—the way things work and the way they interact—and between the symbolic and the material—the meanings that things carry and the realities that sustain them. At its core, design seeks to make sense visible: to render the abstract intelligible, the functional graceful, and the complex harmonious. It is an art of synthesis, where logic meets intuition and where every choice, however minute, becomes a statement about how we wish the world to be organized, experienced, and remembered.

### Advice

| **Category**           | **Advice**                               | **Description**                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Space Planning**     | **Start with function**                  | Identify how each area will be used before deciding on layout or style.                    |
| **Space Planning**     | **Maintain clear circulation**           | Leave at least 90 cm of walking space between furniture and walls.                         |
| **Proportion & Scale** | **Match furniture to room size**         | Avoid oversized pieces in small rooms; scale elements to spatial volume.                   |
| **Lighting**           | **Layer your lighting**                  | Combine ambient, task, and accent lighting for flexibility and depth.                      |
| **Lighting**           | **Use warm light for comfort zones**     | Softer, warm-toned lighting enhances relaxation and intimacy.                              |
| **Color & Material**   | **Use color to shape perception**        | Light colors expand space; darker tones create intimacy and focus.                         |
| **Color & Material**   | **Limit the palette**                    | Stick to 3–4 dominant hues to maintain visual coherence.                                   |
| **Texture & Surface**  | **Mix textures subtly**                  | Combine matte and glossy, soft and hard surfaces for sensory balance.                      |
| **Furnishing**         | **Prioritize comfort and accessibility** | Always test seating and ensure furniture supports daily activity patterns.                 |
| **Storage**            | **Integrate storage into design**        | Conceal storage in built-ins or use multi-functional furniture to reduce clutter.          |
| **Acoustics**          | **Use soft materials strategically**     | Rugs, curtains, and upholstery absorb sound and reduce echo.                               |
| **Visual Composition** | **Create focal points**                  | Anchor each room with one dominant element—art, light fixture, or furniture piece.         |
| **Flow & Continuity**  | **Repeat motifs and materials**          | Use recurring elements (colors, trims, finishes) to unify different spaces.                |
| **Sustainability**     | **Prefer durable materials**             | Invest in quality items that age well rather than disposable décor.                        |
| **Adaptability**       | **Design for change**                    | Choose modular or movable elements that can adapt to new needs or configurations.          |
| **Budgeting**          | **Invest in long-term impact**           | Spend more on key items (lighting, flooring, main furniture) and economize on accessories. |
| **Personalization**    | **Express identity through detail**      | Use art, textiles, or objects that reflect the inhabitant’s story and taste.               |
