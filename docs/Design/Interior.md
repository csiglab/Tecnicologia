# Interior Design

> The discipline concerned with shaping interior spaces into coherent, functional, and expressive environments that support human activity and perception.

## Formulation

> Interior Design : Space → Organized Environment / Under Human Interpertain.

> A transformation function where Space represents raw spatial potential, and Organized Environment denotes spatial configuration structured by function, aesthetics, and experience.

## Design Meta Principle(s)

> A meta-principle operates at a higher level than stylistic or technical rules: it governs how principles are selected, prioritized, and interpreted by the design agent (human or artificial). It reflects the cognitive and systemic framework through which a designer perceives, evaluates, and structures a spatial environment.

> The meta-principles are grounded in three fundamental dimensions: the **Cognitive–Perceptual**, the **Functional–Systemic**, and the **Symbolic**.

> The fundamental problem of design lies in reconciling the multiplicity of human intentions, perceptual constraints, and systemic realities into a coherent whole. Design is not merely the act of shaping form or function, but the continuous negotiation between cognition and perception—the way things are understood and the way they are seen—between functionality and systemic order—the way things work and the way they interact—and between the symbolic and the material—the meanings that things carry and the realities that sustain them. At its core, design seeks to make sense visible: to render the abstract intelligible, the functional graceful, and the complex harmonious. It is an art of synthesis, where logic meets intuition and where every choice, however minute, becomes a statement about how we wish the world to be organized, experienced, and remembered.
